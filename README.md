### Appeal
Simulation maybe barely passes the minimum requirements. HOWEVER, I did do this entire thing from scratch without the outline because I know how to write classes and methods but I'm not great at structuring big projects like this. I do think I was correct and that I did learn more by doing it this way but as a result may not have the requirements exactly right. 

Should I pass the class? Well of course *I* think I should. I do think I have the required proficiency to progress to CS1.2. (Plus you know I aced the final)

## State of the project:
### Example Summary
``` python
## Herd Immunity Simulation:
### Starting Stats
Population Size: 1000
Vaccination Percentage: 10%
Virus Name: cooties
Mortality Rate: 40%
Basic Reproduction Number: 60%
People Initially Infected: 5
### Post-Infection Population Stats:
People who died: 346
People who survived the infection: 654
Steps to pathogen burnout: 3
```
### Example Log
``` python
0: 1000 infected, 0 dead, 100 now immune
Donna survives the infection!
Alice survives the infection!
Irene survives the infection!
Hailey, human#3, has died of cooties.
....
Charlie did not die because they were immune.
Patrick did not die because they were immune.
Katie did not die because they were immune.
5: 0 infected, 346 dead, 654 now immune
```
