### Appeal
Simulation does not QUITE pass the requirements. HOWEVER, I did do this entire thing from scratch without the outline because I know how to write classes but I'm not great at structuring big projects like this. I think I was correct and that I did learn more by doing it this way but as a result will not fulfill the requirements on time. 

Should I pass the class? Well of course *I* think I should. I do think I have the required proficiency to progress to CS1.2. (Plus you know I aced the final)
